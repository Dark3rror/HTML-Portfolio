<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  Hello, I'm Brandon. Welcome to my page and thank you for taking the time to
  come by and see what I've been working on. Currently, I work as a warehouse
  material handler, I hold a CDL with endorsement in hazardous materials, tank
  wagon, and double trailers. I am a father to a 14 year old and I really enjoy
  playing video games, photography, cybersecurity and shooting.

  I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio. When I was 13 I developed an interest in
  computers and all they can do. My earlest memory of cybersecurity was using
  the firewall settings to lock out the internet connection when my parents made
  me mad. That was short lived cause I would get in trouble and instead of
  getting my butt beat I just showed them how I did it. However, my love for
  technology didn't stop there I would figure out how to take things apart and
  put them back together; whether or not they worked again was a whole another
  story.

<p>
  Today I still love learning more and more about technology. My goal is to get
  out of logistics and transportation and work in IT. Cybersecurity would be a
  goal of mine but I have found I really like web development and with our world
  becoming more relient on technology I believe having and training multiple
  skills is required. This is why I'm teaching myself web development,
  cybersecurity and python programming. it is my hope that some day soon I can
  work in IT and apply the skills I've learned and create a wonderful living and
  example for my daugther. Thank you again for stopping by my page and check
  back regularly as I will be updating it with new skills.
